# ðŸš€ **What is OOAD?**

## **What is Object-Oriented Analysis and Design (OOAD)?**

**OOAD** stands for **Object-Oriented Analysis and Design**. It is a method of designing and organizing software systems using **objects** and **classes**. The goal of OOAD is to break down a complex system into smaller, manageable components that can be designed, developed, and tested independently.

## **ðŸ”‘ Key Concepts in OOAD**

### **1. Objects and Classes**
- **Objects** are individual instances of a **class**. 
- A **class** is like a blueprint or a template that defines what attributes (data) and methods (actions) an object will have.
  
For example, think of a `Dog` class. You can create many `Dog` objects, each with its own characteristics like name, breed, and age.

```java
class Dog {
    // Attributes
    String name;
    String breed;
    int age;
    
    // Method
    public void bark() {
        System.out.println("Woof!");
    }
}
